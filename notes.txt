Bugs

- Camera closed when not actually open -> illegalstate exception
errors...
 Unable to resume activity {com.example.kiki.impro/com.example.kiki.impro.MainActivity}: java.lang.RuntimeException: Time out waiting to lock camera opening
'void android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest$Builder.set(android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest$Key, java.lang.Object)' on a null object reference

TODOs 

- add jpg / png option
- add listener to quality preference so that we can change it while picture has been taken
- add interface to fileopenerlist / dialog for choosing file on click.
- don't make filtering happen all the time.
